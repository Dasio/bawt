Bawt has built in support for [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)

#### Why Bolt?

You can read more about Bolt above, but this is why Bolt has stayed a part of Bawt:

* Simple
* Lightweight
* Resilient

That said, Bolt isn't meant for everything. If you have a usecase for a different datastore then add it!

#### Tools
- [BoltDB Web](https://github.com/evnix/boltdbweb) - A web frontend for browsing BoltDB
- [Bolt Browser](https://github.com/br0xen/boltbrowser) - A command line browser for BoltDB
- [Bolter](https://github.com/hasit/bolter) - A machine friendly CLI for interrogating BoltDB
