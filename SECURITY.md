## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Foreword
- The maintainers of this project make no money in return for their contributions. Asking for a reward apart from recognition will probably not go very far.
- Contributions from members like you are how this project stays alive.
- There are corporations that utilize this framework, and out of respect for them and their safety, at times vulnerabilities must be cloaked in secrecy until they've been properly patched.

### Steps
This is a five part process that most vulnerabilities will probably fall within without much adjustment.
1. :calling: **Contact**. Reach out to [Matt Ouille](https://github.com/mattouille) on social media (LinkedIn usually works) with a demo
2. :bar_chart: **Planning**. Depending on the circumstance we'll open an issue and corresponding PR
3. :bug: **Testing**. We'll verify through tests that the vulnerability is, in fact, fixed
4. :rocket: **Release**. We'll cut a new release
5. :loudspeaker: **Notification**. After a minimum of two weeks we will send out a [Security Advisory via GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-maintainer-security-advisories)
